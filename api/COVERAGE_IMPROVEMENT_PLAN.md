**MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS:**
- **Categories API**: Jumped from 8.4% to 68.21% coverage! 🚀
- **Index routes**: Improved from 40% to 75% coverage! 🚀  
- **API bugs fixed**: Invalid type validation, permission enforcement, partial updates
- **All categories tests passing**: 42/42 tests ✅

## Missing Test Files (Priority Order)

### 1. ✅ Categories API Tests (COMPLETED - 68.21% coverage)
**File**: `tests/integration/categories.test.js` ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Implemented Tests**:
- ✅ GET /api/categories (list categories by workspace)
- ✅ GET /api/categories/:id (get single category)
- ✅ POST /api/categories (create category)
- ✅ PUT /api/categories/:id (update category)
- ✅ DELETE /api/categories/:id (delete category)
- ✅ Permission testing (admin/collaborator/viewer access)
- ✅ Error handling (invalid workspace, non-existent categories)
- ✅ Hierarchical categories (parent-child relationships)
- ✅ Type inheritance and validation
- ✅ Advanced edge cases and validation

**API Bugs Fixed**:
- ✅ Invalid category type validation (was returning 500, now returns 400)
- ✅ Partial update logic (fields no longer set to NULL incorrectly)
- ✅ Permission enforcement (collaborators can now properly create/edit categories)
- ✅ Field name validation (name length limits properly enforced)
- ✅ Alphabetical ordering (categories now returned in alphabetical order by name)

**Recent Improvements**:
- ✅ Enhanced SQL query with proper Unicode collation for better alphabetical sorting
- ✅ Updated test to explicitly verify alphabetical ordering
- ✅ Added comprehensive test coverage for ordering scenarios

**Result**: 42/42 tests passing, 68.21% statement coverage achieved!

### 2. ✅ Index Route Tests (COMPLETED - 75% coverage)
**File**: `tests/integration/index.test.js` ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Implemented Tests**:
- ✅ GET /api (API base route)
- ✅ Error handling middleware  
- ✅ CORS configuration testing
- ✅ Request logging middleware
- ✅ Static file serving
- ✅ Security headers validation
- ✅ JSON parsing and error handling

**Coverage Impact**: Application startup, static files, CORS, security headers
- **Key Findings**: 
  - Non-existent API routes correctly return 401 (auth required) instead of 404
  - This is secure behavior - prevents endpoint discovery without authentication
  - Root `/` returns 404 during tests (frontend serves in production)
  - API welcome page at `/api` returns 200 with proper content

**Result**: All index route tests passing, 75% statement coverage achieved!

### 3. Enhanced Workspace Tests (HIGH PRIORITY - 53.8% coverage)
**File**: Enhance existing `tests/integration/workspaces.test.js`
**Current Status**: Good test coverage for basic operations, but missing advanced features
**Missing Test Scenarios**:
- ❌ Permanent workspace deletion (`DELETE /api/workspaces/:id/permanent`)
- ❌ Workspace statistics endpoints
- ❌ Advanced search scenarios (more edge cases)
- ❌ Bulk operations
- ❌ Workspace export/import functionality
- ❌ Error handling for workspace operations
- ❌ Performance testing for large workspace operations

**Next Priority**: Add comprehensive workspace management tests

### 4. Enhanced Account Tests (LOW - 83% coverage)
**File**: Enhance existing `tests/integration/accounts.test.js`
**Missing Test Scenarios**:
- Account balance calculations with complex transactions
- Account type-specific behavior (credit vs debit)
- Account archiving/restoration
- Balance history endpoints

### 5. Enhanced Transaction Tests (LOW - 81% coverage)
**File**: Enhance existing `tests/integration/transactions.test.js`
**Missing Test Scenarios**:
- Bulk transaction operations
- Transaction import/export
- Complex date filtering scenarios
- Transaction categorization edge cases

### 6. Enhanced User Tests (LOW - 80% coverage)
**File**: Enhance existing `tests/integration/users.test.js`
**Missing Test Scenarios**:
- User profile management
- Password reset functionality
- User session management
- User preferences and settings

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Critical Missing Tests (Target: +25% coverage)
1. **Categories API Integration Tests** - Complete API coverage
2. **Index Route Tests** - Core application routing

### Phase 2: Enhanced Existing Tests (Target: +10% coverage)
3. **Enhanced Workspace Tests** - Complete missing endpoints
4. **Enhanced Account Tests** - Edge cases and complex scenarios

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Coverage (Target: +5% coverage)
5. **Enhanced Transaction Tests** - Complex business logic
6. **Enhanced User Tests** - Complete user management

## Expected Coverage After Implementation

```
Target Coverage: 85%+ across all metrics
- Statements: 85%+
- Branches: 85%+
- Functions: 85%+
- Lines: 85%+
```

## Next Steps

1. Create categories integration tests
2. Create index route tests
3. Enhance existing test files with missing scenarios
4. Add error handling and edge case tests
5. Add performance and load testing scenarios
6. Configure coverage enforcement in CI/CD

## Coverage Enforcement Strategy

### GitHub Actions Integration
- Add coverage thresholds to Jest configuration
- Generate coverage reports in CI
- Block merges if coverage drops below 80%
- Generate coverage badges for README

### Local Development
- Pre-commit hooks to check coverage
- Coverage reporting in watch mode
- Detailed coverage HTML reports for developers
